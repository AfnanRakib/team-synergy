## Week 1: Idea Generation, Background Research, and Pitch Preparation  
**Dates: December 27, 2024 – January 2, 2025**

This week marked the launch of our Learnathon 3.0 journey. We started with a team brainstorming session where ideas flowed freely, and we explored various directions for our Flutter app. We discussed potential user needs and the unique value our project could offer in the competitive landscape.

Simultaneously, we conducted background research on similar apps and market trends. A key milestone was receiving an email from our mentor, instructing us to prepare a comprehensive pitch deck. This guidance helped us focus our efforts on refining our project proposal, mapping out a clear vision, and setting the stage for the weeks to come.

## Week 2: Post-Pitch Feasibility Analysis and Refinement  
**Dates: January 3, 2025 – January 9, 2025**

After submitting our initial pitch, we spent Week 2 analyzing its feasibility. We held an in-depth meeting with our mentor to review our pitch deck and discuss both technical and conceptual aspects. The feedback we received prompted us to identify potential risks and necessary improvements.

Based on these discussions, we collaboratively redefined our project objectives and streamlined our approach. Each team member was tasked with specific refinements, ensuring that our revised plan was both ambitious and realistic. By the end of the week, we had a solid, revised proposal that aligned with industry standards and our mentor’s insights.

## Week 3: Basic Wireframing of the Whole Project  
**Dates: January 10, 2025 – January 16, 2025**

During Week 3, our focus shifted to translating our ideas into visual representations. We organized multiple wireframing sessions to design the essential pages of the app, such as the login, dashboard, and key feature screens. Our initial sketches were aimed at establishing a clear and intuitive navigation flow.

The team engaged in lively discussions about user experience, debating the best ways to present content and functionality. We refined our layouts based on feedback and usability principles, ensuring each element served a clear purpose. The culmination of this week was a set of coherent wireframes that laid the groundwork for future design iterations.

## Week 4: GitHub and Flutter Learning  
**Dates: January 17, 2025 – January 23, 2025**

This week, we focused on building our technical foundations. Our mentor conducted a session on using GitHub effectively for version control and team collaboration. We set up our repositories, learned branching strategies, and practiced conflict resolution, which proved invaluable for our team dynamics.

Alongside GitHub, we immersed ourselves in Flutter basics. We explored its widget-based structure through online tutorials and hands-on exercises, gradually building a clear understanding of Flutter’s capabilities. This dual approach not only enhanced our technical skill set but also ensured that we were ready to integrate these tools into our development process.

## Week 5: Basic Flutter & Firebase Setup and Authentication Implementation  
**Dates: January 24, 2025 – January 30, 2025**

Week 5 marked our first major development milestone. Under our mentor’s guidance, we set up our Flutter development environment and integrated Firebase to manage our backend needs. We focused on implementing a basic authentication system, covering login, signup, and a preliminary dashboard.

The week involved several hands-on sessions where we experimented with Firebase’s authentication services, ensuring that user data was managed securely. Along with this technical work, we also learned valuable lessons on collaborative coding through GitHub, addressing code conflicts and refining our teamwork practices. By week’s end, our prototype demonstrated essential functionality, paving the way for more complex integrations.

## Week 6: UI/UX Building with Prototype and Full-Project Wireframing  
**Dates: January 31, 2025 – February 6, 2025**

In Week 6, we transitioned from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity UI/UX designs using Figma. Our design sessions were detailed and collaborative, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly prototype. We refined color schemes, typography, and layout consistency to align with our project vision.

Interactive prototypes were developed to simulate user interactions, allowing us to test navigation flows and refine usability. This iterative process, enriched by internal feedback sessions, helped us iron out design inconsistencies. By the end of the week, we had a polished UI/UX prototype that served as a comprehensive blueprint for the development team.

## Weeks 7–8: Deep Dive into ValueNotifier, Supabase, MVVM, and Database Relationships  
**Dates: February 7, 2025 – February 20, 2025**

Over these two weeks, our focus shifted to mastering advanced technical concepts critical for our app’s scalability. We dedicated time to learning about ValueNotifier for efficient state management, explored Supabase as an alternative backend solution, and began implementing the MVVM architecture to maintain a clean code structure.

Our mentor provided detailed feedback on our designs and technical plans, prompting us to deepen our understanding of robust database relationships. Each team member tackled specific topics through individual research and group coding sessions. Despite the challenges, our collaborative efforts enabled us to integrate these advanced methodologies into our project framework.

## Week 9: Adopting Provider & Restructuring the Project Setup  
**Dates: February 21, 2025 – February 27, 2025**

In Week 9, we focused on optimizing our project’s architecture by incorporating the Provider package for state management. We began with a series of study sessions on best practices and gradually refactored parts of our codebase to align with these new standards.

The restructuring process involved reorganizing our project directories and addressing data flow challenges within our existing components. Detailed code reviews and pair programming sessions allowed us to troubleshoot and fine-tune our approach. Although the migration presented its challenges, the improved organization has resulted in a more modular and scalable codebase, setting a strong foundation for future developments.

## Week 10: In-Depth Provider Learning & Overcoming Development Challenges  
**Dates: February 28, 2025 – March 6, 2025**

Week 10 was dedicated to deepening our knowledge of the Provider package and addressing emerging technical challenges. We engaged with comprehensive online documentation, video tutorials, and community forums to explore advanced state management techniques.

During this period, we encountered issues such as widget performance bottlenecks and subtle bugs in data synchronization. These challenges led to extensive team discussions and troubleshooting sessions, allowing us to experiment with alternative approaches. Our persistent efforts resulted in refined code practices and a more stable, efficient project structure, ready for the next phase of development.

## Week 11: Refining Login, Signup, and Dashboard as per UI Prototype  
**Dates: March 7, 2025 – March 13, 2025**

In Week 11, we officially transitioned into polishing our core user-facing components. The focus was on refining the login, signup, and dashboard pages to mirror our high-fidelity UI prototypes. We adhered to the MVVM architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and an optimal user experience.

We conducted multiple testing sessions, code reviews, and user interface walkthroughs to identify and fix inconsistencies. The team worked together to optimize animations, layout designs, and error handling. Feedback from both internal tests and our mentor was meticulously integrated into the final designs. By the end of the week, our refined components not only functioned seamlessly but also provided an engaging and intuitive user experience, marking a significant milestone in our development journey.
